# Grid-Free Constraints for Parameter-Dependent Generalized Gramians via Full Block S-Procedure

## General

This repository contains the simulation code to reproduce the tables and figures presented in

L. Heeren and H. Werner, "Grid-Free Constraints for Parameter-Dependent Generalized Gramians via Full Block S-Procedure", *20th European Control Conference*, 2022

The code has three main entry points, the scripts `example1.m`, `example2.m` and `example3.m`.
They will produce among others the material presented in the paper

## Prerequisites

To run the simulation files, some additional packages need to be installed first.
1. Install *Yalmip*, e.g. according to [this guide](https://yalmip.github.io/tutorial/installation/)
2. Install [*Mosek*](https://www.mosek.com/)
3. Install [*LPVTools*](https://seiler.engin.umich.edu/software/)


The simulation code in this repository was tested in the following environment:
* *Windows 10* Version 20H2
* *Matlab* 2020b
* *Yalmip* 20190425
* *MOSEK* 9.2
* *LPVTools* 1.0
